# Assignment 2 - Pandas Introduction
# All questions are weighted the same in this assignment.

# Part 1
# The following code loads the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derrived from the Wikipedia entry on All Time Olympic Games Medals, 
# and does some basic data cleaning.

# The columns are organized as # of Summer games, Summer medals, # of Winter games, Winter medals, 
# total # number of games, total # of medals. Use this dataset to answer the questions below.

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('olympics.csv', index_col=0, skiprows=1)

for col in df.columns:
    if col[:2]=='01':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Gold'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='02':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Silver'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='03':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Bronze'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:1]=='№':
        df.rename(columns={col:'#'+col[1:]}, inplace=True)

names_ids = df.index.str.split('\s\(') # split the index by '('

df.index = names_ids.str[0] # the [0] element is the country name (new index) 
df['ID'] = names_ids.str[1].str[:3] # the [1] element is the abbreviation or ID (take first 3 characters from that)

df = df.drop('Totals')
df.head()

# Question 0 (Example given)
# What is the first country in df?
# This function should return a Series.

def answer_zero():
    # This function returns the row for Afghanistan, which is a Series object. The assignment
    # question description will tell you the general format the autograder is expecting
    return df.iloc[0]
answer_zero() 

# Question 1
# Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?
# This function should return a single string value.

def answer_one():
    return df['Gold'].idxmax()
answer_one()

# Question 2
# Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts?
# This function should return a single string value.

def answer_two():
    return (df['Gold'] - df['Gold.1']).idxmax()
answer_two()

# Question 3
# Which country has the biggest difference between their summer gold medal counts and winter gold medal counts 
# relative to their total gold medal count?
# (Summer Gold−Winter Gold)/Total Gold
# Only include countries that have won at least 1 gold in both summer and winter.
# This function should return a single string value.

def answer_three():
    df_more = df[(df['Gold']>=1) & (df['Gold.1']) >=1]
    return (((df_more['Gold'])-(df_more['Gold.1']))/df_more['Gold.2']).abs().argmax()
answer_three()

# Question 4
# Write a function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value 
# where each gold medal (Gold.2) counts for 3 points, silver medals (Silver.2) for 2 points, 
# and bronze medals (Bronze.2) for 1 point. The function should return only the column (a Series object) which you created, 
# with the country names as indices.
# This function should return a Series named Points of length 146

def answer_four():
    df['Points'] = pd.Series((df['Gold.2']*3) + (df['Silver.2']*2) + df['Bronze.2'])
    return df['Points']
answer_four()

# Part 2
# For the next set of questions, we will be using census data from the United States Census Bureau. 
# Counties are political and geographic subdivisions of states in the United States. 
# This dataset contains population data for counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015. 
# See this document (https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts/2010-2015/co-est2015-alldata.pdf) for a description of the variable names.
#The census dataset (census.csv) should be loaded as census_df. Answer questions using this as appropriate.

# Question 5
# Which state has the most counties in it? (hint: consider the sumlevel key carefully! 
# You'll need this for future questions too...)
# This function should return a single string value.

census_df = pd.read_csv('census.csv')
census_df.head()

def answer_five():
    return census_df.groupby(['STNAME']).sum()['COUNTY'].idxmax()
answer_five()

# Question 6
# Only looking at the three most populous counties for each state, 
# what are the three most populous states (in order of highest population to lowest population)? Use CENSUS2010POP.
# This function should return a list of string values.

def answer_six():
    # groupby STNAME
    # use apply to find the 3 largest values in column CENSUS2010POP and sums them up
    # the resulting series has STNAME as index and the corresponding top 3 counties sum
    # applying nlargest gets a series with the top 3 states as required
    return census_df[census_df['SUMLEV']==50].groupby('STNAME')['CENSUS2010POP'].apply(lambda x: x.nlargest(3).sum()).nlargest(3).index.values.tolist()
answer_six()

# Question 7
# Which county has had the largest absolute change in population within the period 2010-2015? 
# (Hint: population values are stored in columns POPESTIMATE2010 through POPESTIMATE2015, you need to consider all six columns.)
# e.g. If County Population in the 5 year period is 100, 120, 80, 105, 100, 130, then its largest change 
# in the period would be |130-80| = 50.
# This function should return a single string value.

def answer_seven():
    # select SUMLEV to be 50 to consider counties only and set 'CTYNAME' as new index
    # select the only columns needed
    # find the difference between biggest and smallest number for all counties
    # find the biggest difference among the counties
    
    county_only = census_df[census_df['SUMLEV']==50].set_index('CTYNAME')
    years = ['POPESTIMATE2010','POPESTIMATE2011','POPESTIMATE2012','POPESTIMATE2013','POPESTIMATE2014','POPESTIMATE2015']
    return (county_only.loc[:, years].max(axis=1) - county_only.loc[:, years].min(axis=1)).argmax()
answer_seven()

# Question 8
# In this datafile, the United States is broken up into four regions using the "REGION" column.
# Create a query that finds the counties that belong to regions 1 or 2, whose name starts with 'Washington', 
# and whose POPESTIMATE2015 was greater than their POPESTIMATE 2014.
# This function should return a 5x2 DataFrame with the columns = ['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'] and the same index ID 
# as the census_df (sorted ascending by index).

def answer_eight():
    # findes counties that belongs to regions 1 or 2
    # and whose name starts with 'Washington'
    # and whose 'POPESTIMATE2015' was > 'POPESTIMATE 2014'
    
    region_county = census_df[(census_df['SUMLEV']==50) & ((census_df['REGION'] ==1) | (census_df['REGION'] ==2))]
    start_washington = region_county[region_county['CTYNAME'].str.startswith('Washington')]
    popestimate_comparison = start_washington[start_washington['POPESTIMATE2015']> start_washington['POPESTIMATE2014']]
    return popestimate_comparison[['STNAME','CTYNAME']]
